# task_app



Group the tasks up into grinds. Grinds consist of 25 minutes of intense work followed by a five minute relax period following otherwise known as the Pomodoro Technique.
The user can make a task and give a rough estimate of the length to achieve it and the difficulty of the task. If the task would take significant time then the task is then required to be broken down into seshes consisting of multiple grinds.

-when the user starts a grind its going to give a short three second countdown (something similar to the start of wipeout or American Ninja Warrior )# taskApp
